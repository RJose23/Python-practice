Hi everyone, for a good portion of my time initially learning python, I was incredibly intimidated by sites such as Hackerrank, Leetcode etc and I ended up not solving problems and fell into a tutorial vortex where I just kept doing one tutorial after another. In this repo, I have taken some beginner friendly problems and solved it my way. This might not be the best or even the easiest solution out there, so feel free to google the question incase you dont understand my code or if you feel there are better ways to do it! Happy learning !
